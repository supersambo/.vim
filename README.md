#Vim setup
This is my personal vm setup. It's everything but sophisticated, just using this to get my basic  vim settings synced across various machines. 

Using vim 8's native package handling instead of pathogen now.

To install this use...
```
    git clone --recursive  git@github.com:supersambo/.vim.git

```

...in home directory.
